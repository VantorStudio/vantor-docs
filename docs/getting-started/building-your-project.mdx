# Building Your Project

This guide covers how to build your Vantor Engine project using CMake, including platform-specific configurations and build system setup.

## Build System Overview

Vantor Engine uses CMake as its primary build system, which provides cross-platform support and flexible configuration options. The build process involves:

1. **Configuration** - CMake generates platform-specific build files
2. **Compilation** - The actual building of source code
3. **Linking** - Combining object files and libraries

## Project Structure

Before building, ensure your project has the following structure:

```
MyVantorProject/
â”œâ”€â”€ Vantor/                  # Engine Directory
â”œâ”€â”€ Source/                 # Your source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (other source files)
â”œâ”€â”€ Build/                  # Build output directory
â”œâ”€â”€ Assets/                 # Game assets (optional)
â””â”€â”€CMakeLists.txt         # CMake configuration
```

## Platform Configuration

Vantor Engine supports multiple platforms through CMake variables. You can specify the target platform during configuration.

### Setting Platform Variables

Use the `PLATFORM` variable to specify your target platform:

```bash
# Windows
cmake -DPLATFORM=Windows ..

# Linux
cmake -DPLATFORM=Linux ..

# Nintendo Switch (Experimental and not avalible to public yet)
cmake -DPLATFORM=Switch ..
```

## Building the Project

### Step 1: Create Build Directory if not done yet

First, create and navigate to the Build directory:

```bash
cd MyVantorProject
mkdir -p Build
cd Build
```

:::tip
Always build in a separate directory to keep your source tree clean. This is called an "out-of-source build."
:::

### Step 2: Configure with CMake

Configure your project for the target platform:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>


<TabItem value="linux">
```
# Building with Make
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPLATFORM=Linux ..
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">
```bash
# Building with Make
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPLATFORM=Windows ..
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Build the Project

Once configured, build your project:

```bash
# Build project using Make
make
```

### Build Configuration Options

You can customize your build with additional CMake variables:

:::note
These features will be implemented later on!
:::

### Custom Build Directory Names

Organize builds by platform and configuration:

```bash
# Create platform-specific build directories
mkdir Build-Windows-Release
mkdir Build-Linux-Debug

# Configure each separately
cd Build-Windows-Release
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPLATFORM=Windows ../..
```

### Clean Builds

Remove build artifacts and start fresh:

```bash
# Clean build files
cmake --build . --target clean

# Or remove the entire Build directory
cd ..
rm -rf Build
mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake ..
```

## Running Your Built Project

After a successful build, your executable will be in the Build directory:

```bash
# Windows
./MyVantorProject.exe

# Linux
./MyVantorProject
```

## Troubleshooting Build Issues

### Common Problems

**CMake not found:**
```bash
# Install CMake
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install cmake

# Windows - Download from https://cmake.org
```

**Compiler not found:**
- Ensure you have a C++20 compatible compiler installed
- On Windows, install Visual Studio or MinGW
- On Linux, install build-essential: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

**Missing dependencies:**
- Make sure all git submodules are initialized: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Install platform-specific dependencies as listed in the prerequisites

**Build fails with linking errors:**
- Check that all required libraries are installed
- Verify the VANTOR_ENGINE_PATH points to the correct location
- Ensure platform-specific libraries are available

Happy building! ðŸ”¨
