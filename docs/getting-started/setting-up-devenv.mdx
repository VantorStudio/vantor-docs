# Setting up your Environment

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment for Vantor Engine, including cloning the engine with all its dependencies and creating your first project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git** - Version control system
- **CMake** - Build system (version 3.16 or higher recommended)
- **Make and a C++ compiler** - GCC, Clang, or MSVC with C++20 support
- **Python 3** - For build scripts and tools

:::note
Before you clone, make a new project folder where your project will be an change into that directoy

## Cloning Vantor Engine

Vantor Engine uses git submodules for managing dependencies. To clone the repository with all its submodules, use the `--recursive` flag:


```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LukasRennhofer/Vantor.git
```

:::tip
If you've already cloned the repository without the `--recursive` flag, you can initialize and update the submodules with:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
:::

## Project Structure Setup

Once you have Vantor Engine cloned, you'll need to create your project structure. Here's how to set up a basic project:

### 1. Create the Source Folder

Create a `Source` folder to contain your source code:

```bash
mkdir Source
mkdir Build
```

Your project structure should now look like this:
```
MyVantorProject/
├── Vantor/
├── Source/
├── Build/
└── CMakeLists.txt (we'll create this next)
```

### 3. Create CMakeLists.txt

Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file in your project root with the following content:

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Include CMake build files
include(Vantor/Vantor/CMake/VantorCMake.cmake)

project(MyVantorProject) # Replace this with your project name
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

# Add engine subdirectory
add_subdirectory(Vantor/Vantor/Source ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/VantorBuild)

# Add Source Code of project
add_executable(MyVantorProject Source/main.cpp)

# Set up Project Target for Vantor
SetUpVantorTarget(MyVantorProject)

# Include Engine API Includes
target_include_directories(MyVantorProject PRIVATE Vantor//Vantor/Include)

# Link with Vantor
target_link_libraries(MyVantorProject PRIVATE Vantor)
```

:::note
Make sure to ajdust the path of the Engine, according to your own environment.
:::

### 4. Create main.cpp

Create your main application file in the `Source` folder

```bash
touch Source/main.cpp
```

## Development Workflow

Here's a typical development workflow when working with Vantor Engine:

1. **Make changes** to your source code in the `Source` folder
2. **Build** your project using `cmake` from the build directory
3. **Test** your changes by running the executable
4. **Debug** using your preferred debugger or IDE

## IDE Setup

### Visual Studio Code

For VS Code users, create a `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
    "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/Build",
    "cmake.sourceDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "files.associations": {
        "*.h": "cpp",
        "*.cpp": "cpp"
    }
}
```

### CLion

CLion should automatically detect your CMakeLists.txt file and configure the project.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Submodule not found errors:**
- Make sure you cloned with `--recursive` or ran `git submodule update --init --recursive`

**Build errors:**
- Check that you have a C++20 compatible compiler
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed

**Runtime errors:**
- Check that assets are copied to the correct output directory
