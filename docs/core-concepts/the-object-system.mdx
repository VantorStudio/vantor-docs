# Vantor's Object System

In commercial engines like Unreal Engine, you work with **Entities** that represent objects in your game or scene that you want to render or interact with. You can attach **Components** to these entities, where each entity can have multiple components, but only one of each type.

For example, a Camera (which is an Entity) can have both a `TransformComponent` and a `MeshComponent` simultaneously. The `TransformComponent` handles the position and rotation of the camera, while the `MeshComponent` provides the renderable representation of the camera, allowing you to visualize where it's located in the scene.

Vantor Engine follows a similar approach using its own custom-built object system with a registry to store and manage all objects efficiently.

:::info Entity-Component-System (ECS)
Vantor's object system is based on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern, which provides:
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add, remove, and modify functionality
- **Performance**: Efficient memory usage and cache-friendly data structures  
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of data and behavior
:::

## Core Concepts

### VObject
**VObjects** are the fundamental entities in Vantor Engine. They represent any object in your game world and can be created using the `VORegistry` (Vantor Object Registry).

### VComponent  
**VComponents** are the functional building blocks that can be attached to VObjects to provide specific capabilities like rendering, physics, audio, or custom game logic.

### VORegistry
The **Vantor Object Registry** manages the lifecycle of all VObjects, providing efficient creation, destruction, and lookup of entities.

## Creating VObjects

We can create new VObject-derived entities and register them with the VORegistry. The registry handles memory management and provides unique identifiers for each object.

Here's an example of creating a camera entity:

```cpp title="Creating a Camera Entity"
#include <Vantor/Vantor.hpp>

int main() {
    Vantor::VApplication app;

    // Application creation data
    Vantor::VApplicationCreateInfo appInfo;
    appInfo.windowWidth = 1280;
    appInfo.windowHeight = 720;
    appInfo.windowTitle = "Object System Demo";

    app.Initialize(appInfo);

    // highlight-start
    // Create a Camera object and position it at (1, 1, 1)
    auto camera = Vantor::Object::VORegistry::CreateEntity<Vantor::Renderer::Camera>(
        Vantor::Math::VVector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)
    );
    // highlight-end

    while (app.IsRunning()) {
        app.BeginFrame();

        // Game update and rendering logic goes here

        app.EndFrame();
    }

    app.Shutdown();
    return 0;
} 
```

:::tip Object Creation
The `CreateEntity<T>()` method is a template function that:
- Creates a new object of type T
- Registers it with the VORegistry
- Returns a shared pointer to the created object
- Automatically handles memory management
:::

## Working with VComponents

Components provide functionality to VObjects. Think of them as modular pieces that define what an object can do or what properties it has.

### Adding Components

We can attach functionality to our objects through components. Each component serves a specific purpose and can be added dynamically at runtime.

Here's how to add a `VTagComponent` to give your camera a name:

```cpp title="Adding Components to Objects"
#include <Vantor/Vantor.hpp>

int main() {
    Vantor::VApplication app;

    // Application setup
    Vantor::VApplicationCreateInfo appInfo;
    appInfo.windowWidth = 1280;
    appInfo.windowHeight = 720;
    appInfo.windowTitle = "Component System Demo";

    app.Initialize(appInfo);

    // Create camera entity
    auto camera = Vantor::Object::VORegistry::CreateEntity<Vantor::Renderer::Camera>(
        Vantor::Math::VVector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)
    );

    // highlight-start
    // Add a TagComponent to identify our camera
    camera->AddComponentVoid<Vantor::Object::VTagComponent>();
    
    // Configure the tag component with a name
    auto tagComponent = camera->GetComponent<Vantor::Object::VTagComponent>();
    tagComponent->SetName("MainCamera");
    // highlight-end

    while (app.IsRunning()) {
        app.BeginFrame();

        // highlight-start
        // Example: Access the camera by its tag
        std::string cameraName = tagComponent->GetName();
        // Use the camera name for debugging or UI purposes
        // highlight-end

        app.EndFrame();
    }

    app.Shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```

### Common VComponents

Vantor Engine provides several built-in components for common functionality:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `VTagComponent` | Object identification and naming |
| `VTransformComponent` | Position, rotation, and scale |
| `VMeshComponent` | 3D model rendering |
| `VMaterialComponent` |Adds Textures, Shaders, Color, ... |
| And more... | |

:::note Component Management
- Use `AddComponentVoid<T>()` to add a component of type T
- Use `GetComponent<T>()` to retrieve an existing component
- Use `HasComponent<T>()` to check if a component exists
- Use `RemoveComponent(T)` to remove a component
:::

## Building Scene Hierarchies

VObjects can be organized in hierarchical structures using parent-child relationships. This is essential for creating complex scenes where objects move together or inherit transformations.

```cpp title="Creating Scene Hierarchies"
// Create a root object for scene organization
auto sceneRoot = Vantor::Object::VORegistry::CreateEntity<Vantor::Object::VObject>();
sceneRoot->AddComponentVoid<Vantor::Object::VTagComponent>();
sceneRoot->GetComponent<Vantor::Object::VTagComponent>()->SetName("SceneRoot");

// highlight-start
// Create a camera group
auto cameraGroup = Vantor::Object::VORegistry::CreateEntity<Vantor::Object::VObject>();
cameraGroup->AddComponentVoid<Vantor::Object::VTagComponent>();
cameraGroup->GetComponent<Vantor::Object::VTagComponent>()->SetName("CameraGroup");

// Add camera as a child of the camera group
cameraGroup->AddChild(camera);

// Add camera group as a child of the scene root
sceneRoot->AddChild(cameraGroup);
// highlight-end
```

### Hierarchy Benefits

When objects are arranged in a hierarchy:

- **Transform Inheritance**: Child objects inherit their parent's transformations
- **Batch Operations**: Operations on parent objects affect all children
- **Logical Organization**: Related objects can be grouped together
- **Scene Management**: Easy to manage complex scenes with nested structures

### Custom Components

You can create your own components by inheriting from `VComponent`:

```cpp title="Custom Component Example"
// highlight-start
class HealthComponent : public Vantor::Object::VComponent {
private:
    float health = 100.0f;
    float maxHealth = 100.0f;

public:
    explicit HealthComponent(Vantor::Object::VObject *owner) : Vantor::Object::VComponent(owner) {}

    void SetHealth(float newHealth) { 
        health = std::clamp(newHealth, 0.0f, maxHealth); 
    }
    
    float GetHealth() const { return health; }
    
    bool IsAlive() const { return health > 0.0f; }
    
    void TakeDamage(float damage) {
        SetHealth(health - damage);
    }
};

// Usage
auto player = Vantor::Object::VORegistry::CreateEntity<Vantor::Object::VObject>();
player->AddComponentVoid<HealthComponent>();
auto playerHealth = player->GetComponent<HealthComponent>();
playerHealth->TakeDamage(25.0f);
// highlight-end
```
