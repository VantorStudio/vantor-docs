# Introduction

**Vantor Engine** is a proprietary game engine developed and used internally by **Vantor Studios**.

It is designed for performance, flexibility, and full control over the engine's architecture, rendering pipeline, and tooling. Vantor Engine powers all of our in-house projects and is intended for educational purposes and not for external use and public distribution, because of it's low-level architecture and it's undetected bugs.
